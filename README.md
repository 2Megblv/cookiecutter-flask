cookiecutter-flask (plus some stuff)
====================================

A(nother) Flask template for cookiecutter.

[cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter)

Modified from the version authored by Github user: [sloria](https://github.com/sloria/cookiecutter-flask.git)

Goals
-----

The primary goal is to have a different logical split of files (models, views and services instead of public, user, etc), which
is purely personal preference.

Secondary is a slight expansion in scope to include other common pages and functionality, which is in progress. So far we
have completed:

 * Forgotten password handling
 * Username change
 * Password change
 * Unsubscribe
 * Google Analytics Integration
 * Heroku Integration
 
In progress are:

 * Simple text and external image blog powered by markdown

For the future are:

 * Sample contact form and page
 * Basic Admin UI
 * Example T\&Cs
 * Social Links/Integration
 * Login outside of the header (maybe modal)
 * Commenting on blog via discus or similar
 * Etc.

A live example can be found here: [CookieCutter Flask Demo](https://cookiecutterflask.herokuapp.com)
